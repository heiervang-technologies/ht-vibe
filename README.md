| Click-to-interact Pokemon shader support | Added support for interactive shader elements | No |

### Branch Strategy

- **`main`** — Clean mirror of upstream `main`. Never commit directly.
- **`ht`** — Default branch with all HT-specific changes.

# Vibe

`vibe` (to have a nice vibe with your music) is a desktop music visualizer inspired by [glava] and [shadertoy] for wayland!

**Note:** Your compositor _must_ support the [`wlr-layer-shell`] protocol. See [here](https://wayland.app/protocols/wlr-layer-shell-unstable-v1#compositor-support)
for a list of compositors on which `vibe` should be able to run.

# Demo

You can click on the image below to see a live demo.

# Features

- support for (multiple) [shadertoy]-_like_-shaders (you can probably use most shaders from [shadertoy], but you can't just simply copy+paste them)
- audio processing support for shaders
- [wgsl] and [glsl] support for shaders
- some [predefined effects](https://github.com/TornaxO7/vibe/wiki/Config#components) which you can choose from

# State

It works on my machine and I've implemented basically everything I wanted and now I'm open for some feedback. For example in form of

- finding bugs
- suggestions or more ideas
- better user experience

Feel free to create an issue if you found a bug and/or an idea discussion if you'd like to suggest something.
However I can't promise to work on every suggestion/bug :>

**Note:** I'm unsure if I'd declare the config file format(s) of `vibe` as "stable", so for the time being: Be prepared for breaking changes.

# Start using `vibe`
`vibe` won't work out of the box probably. Some steps are required.

See [USAGE.md](./USAGE.md) for more information.

# Configure `vibe`

See the [`Config` wiki page](https://github.com/TornaxO7/vibe/wiki).
